## Read
* Familiarize yourself with the [Course Policies]({% link pages/policies.md %}).
* [_Think Python_](http://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/) chapters 1-3. Don't just sit back and read passively, get your hands on the keyboard using your Reading Journal (see below)!
Note the times you start and stop reading (please do this for all the readings). You will use this to avoid working longer than required by the course policy. Also, the reading journal notebook asks how long you spent on the readings and notebook questions – we will use this to calibrate the course work.
* Think Python [chapter 5](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/html/thinkpython2006.html): sections 5.2-5.7 and section 5.11.

## Do
* Make sure to finish up any activities that you didn't get to from the [Day 1 materials](/notes/day-1).
* Complete the [course entrance survey](https://goo.gl/forms/GopqnLvczWUEx33y1) before class on Thursday. This counts towards your participation grade.
* Complete Reading Journal 1. Follow [these instructions]({{site.baseurl}}{% link pages/reading-journal.md %}) to submit it.

## Optional (fun) reading

* [xkcd #353](https://xkcd.com/353/), and [xkcd #353 explained](https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/353:_Python)
