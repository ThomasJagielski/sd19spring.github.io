* Read [Check In Early, Check In Often](https://blog.codinghorror.com/check-in-early-check-in-often/). (Jeff Atwood is the co-creator of *Stack Overflow*. You may have heard of it.)
  * Optional reading: [How Often do you Commit?](http://www.howardism.org/Technical/Git/how-often.html), Howard Abrams
* Review [How to Write a Git Commit Message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).
* Complete Reading Journal 10.
* Make at least one additional commit per person. If you are pair programming, both commits may come from the same account.
  * In general, you should make *at least one commit* per day that you're working on the project. See the readings for more guidance. Thinking about what makes for a good commit *message* can guide you towards the amount of change that makes for a good *commit*.
