* Bring your [MP4 project proposal]({% link _assignments/mini-project-4-interactive-visualization.md %}#project-proposal)
* Read _Think Python_ [Chapter 16](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/html/thinkpython2017.html), [Chapter 17](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/html/thinkpython2018.html)
* Bring your `geometry.py` from [Thursday's activity]({% link _activities/geometry-classes.md %}). You don't need to work further on it outside of class or turn it in â€“ although if you want to work on the Going Beyond sections, you may want to get a head start.

## (Way) Before Class

* By Friday evening, you should have entered your partner and project on the spreadsheet, per [MP4 instructions]({% link _assignments/mini-project-4-interactive-visualization.md %}#getting-started).
