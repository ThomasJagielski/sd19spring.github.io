In order to submit RJ5, you need to commit your work in `shapes.py` as well:

```python
$ cd ReadingJournal
$ git add reading-journal-05.ipynb
$ git add shapes.py
$ git commit -m "Completed reading journal 5"
$ git push origin master

If you come up with some great turtle art you'd like to share, send it to the teaching team or post it on Canvas discussion!
