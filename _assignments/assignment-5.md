## Reading journal instructions

1\. The reading journal refers to `rj5.py`; it means `shapes.py`.

2\. Commit your Python files, that end in `.py`, as well as the notebook. Use the following recipe.

```bash
$ cd ReadingJournal
$ git add reading-journal-*.ipynb
$ git add *.py
$ git commit -m "Completed reading journal 5"
$ git push origin master
```

(In the recipe above, the command `git add *.py` has been added to the instructions from the [Reading Journal page]({% link pages/reading-journal.md %}).)

## Reading Journal 3 (extended deadline)

*Due 8 pm, Tue 19 Sep*

* Complete *Reading Journal 3*, if you didn't already.
