* The [MP4 team spreadsheet]({{ teaming_spreadsheet}}) must contain a link to your team's repo.

By {{ page.due | date: site.due_datetime_format }}:

* Your MP4 GitHub repo should contain (at least) two files such that:
  * One file defines a function, or class that (you think will) be used in your project.
  * The other file `import`s the first file, and uses the function or class that it defines.
