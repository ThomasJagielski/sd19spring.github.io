# Activity 1.3 – Git

## 1. Install Git

On the Set Up web page, follow the instructions under “Get Started with Git”.

## 2. Launch Jupyter

Close your terminal window. Close the Jupyter tab or window of your web browser?

Open a *new* terminal window. Enter `cd ReadingJournal`. Enter `jupyter notebook`.

You should see the Reading Journal in your web browser. The journal is a Jupyter notebook, like the one that you created in the previous activity.

You can use remaining class time, if any, to begin work on the journal.

## 3. For Next Time

Do the reading, and work on the reading journal. When you are done, follow the instructions on the course web site to submit the journal.

**There is more homework for next week than just the reading journal!** You also need to [join Slack](https://sd17fall.slack.com), and [fill out the survey](https://goo.gl/forms/JHSocQE14iEVBnHc2).

The [course site](http://softdes.olin.build) is the ultimate authority on what's due. (And, if it's not clear, ask on Slack.)

## Going Beyond: Explore Git

Later in the course, we will make more extensive use of GitHub and git. If you want to explore earlier, here is a nice tutorial: <https://try.github.io/>.
