## MP3 presentations

We'll take a few minutes for each team to share their [results from the text mining mini project](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1OJnlflZJ7d2TTn07aCHYC4qhxeWp0vMOKbUQrcKQxwA/edit?usp=sharing)


## Reading Journal Debrief
With people sitting around you, debrief on the reading journal.  Were there parts that you were confused by?  Work as a group towards a better understanding and record the questions you have for us to address as a larger group.


## Inheritance and Shapes
We have created a [Jupyter notebook](/notes/Geometry and Inheritance) that lets you practice refactoring a set of classes using inheritance.


## Inheritance Example: counters, multisets, and Bayesian statistics
If you'd like more practice or to see inheritance in another context, we have also posted [a notebook](/notes/Inheritance Counters and PMFs) that walks you through using inheritance to go from the built-in Python collection `Counter` all the way up to Bayesian statistics.
If you're interested in learning more about this topic, you should check out [Think Bayes](http://greenteapress.com/wp/think-bayes/) or Allen's "Computational Bayesian Statistics" course.

As a side note, in order to easily access these notebooks, you might want to clone [the website repository](https://github.com/{{ site.data.github.organization }}/{{ site.data.github.organization }}.github.io).  All the notebooks are in the `notebooks` directory of the repository.
