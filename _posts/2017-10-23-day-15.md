* Class can *inherit* or *associate*
* MVC is an example of association
* A class, like a function, are units of *organization* and *generalization*
  * A class is a unit for naming, documenting, testing
  * State and behavior encapsulated in a class can be more easily replicated across multiple objects
* The relation between a git commit message and the changes is similar to the relation between a function name + documentation, and the function body

## Bouncing Ball Files

* [`mvc-1.py`]({% link files/mvc/mvc-1.py %}) has just a `Ball` class
* [`mvc-2.py`]({% link files/mvc/mvc-2.py %}) factors `BallView` out of `Ball`
* [`mvc-3.py`]({% link files/mvc/mvc-3.py %}) replaced `BallView` by `LeftBallView` and `RightBallView`
* [`mvc-4.py`]({% link files/mvc/mvc-4.py %}) factors `WorldController` out of the main (top-level) event loop
* [`mvc-5.py`]({% link files/mvc/mvc-5.py %}) factors `WorldController` out of the main (top-level) event loop
