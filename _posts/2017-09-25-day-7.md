## When is a Friday not a Friday?

* This Friday 29 Nov is an Olin Monday.
* Olin Mondays suck for cross-registered students, so I will minimize new material on that day.
* Olin Mondays suck for course load, so there will be no homework due on that day.
* This (day-of-the-week) Friday will be studio time for MP2 Computational Art.

* Decomposing functionality into functions lets you "zoom in" – understand, test in bite size chunks
* Ideally, wrapping functionality into a function ("word", from "Growing a Language"), e.g. `rest_of_ORF`, lets you forget about *how* it works when you move onto the next function, e.g. `find_all_ORFs`, that uses it
* Ideally, adding doctests to a function lets you forget about how *whether* it works
* Ideally, this entails that when you find a bug in `find_all_ORFs` you don't have to look inside `rest_of_ORF` for the bug
* Actually, `rest_of_ORF` might have a bug not exposed by its tests
  * "Theory and practice are the same, in theory"
* At the minimum, fix the bug. But then it might pop up again later, when you fix *another* bug.
  * Lots of programming is figuring out how not to play whack a mole
* Better: add a test after you test the bug. "Push your tests down."
* Best: add a test *and then* fix the bug. Then you can *zoom in* on `rest_of_ORF`.
* This is an example of a commutator – does swapping the order of tasks improve your workflow?

## Cookbooks and Recipes

* The oldest cookbook in the world is from the [Yale Library collection](https://www.library.yale.edu/neareast/exhibitions/cuisine.html). It's written in Akkadian, not (as I proposed in class) Sumerian or Babylonian.
* Our class recipe book is [here]({% link pages/recipes.md %})

## Computational Art Kick-Off

* MP2 Computational Art is due Monday 2 Nov.
* Computational Art blends two topics: raster graphics, and recursion.

## Turtles

* [Seymour Papert describes the turtle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDyym_9-E-g), _YouTube_.
* [The original turtle](http://www.extremenxt.com/walter.htm), W. Grey Walter

## Raster Graphics

* "Raster" is from "grid" or "rake"
* At each *location* (on the grid), there's a *color* (below)
* Locations are represented as (typically integer) `[x, y]` or `(x, y)`.

## Color

[![](/images/notes/day7/rgb-color-wheel-lg.jpg){: width="250px" style="float: right" }](http://dawnsbrain.com/the-rgb-color-wheel/)

* Colors in computer graphics are typically represented as color component triplets `(red, green, blue)`
* Triplets, in turn, are typically represented by Python **tuples**. At this stage of the course, a tuple behaves as a list: `(2, 4, 6)` behaves as `[2, 4, 6]` (although they are not Python `==`).
* This represents the physical mechanism of a standard computer display.
* Not coincidentally, it also agrees with the biology of human color perception.
* Red, green, blue are the **additive** primaries: perceptible colors can be created by adding different amounts of primary colors.
* Inks use **subtractive** colors. An ink absorbs a specific wavelength (subtracts a particular color) and reflects back the rest. This is why the primary colors used in paint are different (in fact, opposite) from the primary colors used in light.
* Color component values typically range from 0.0 (no color) to 1.0 (fully on); from 0 to 255; or from 0 to 65535.

## Recursion

* The [in-class activity]({% link _activities/recursion.md %}) explores recursion in the context of three different domains: math (numbers), text (strings), and graphics.
* Recursion adds to our list of tools to model or reproduce a process: functions (something happens a few times…), parameters (…differently), iteration (repeated process or structure), recursion (composed of pieces that look like smaller versions of itself)
* Some problems can be done by analysis (calculation), iteration, or recursion
  * Analysis is often simpler when it works
  * Choose the simplest strategy that works
  * "Simple" is a judgment call
* [This notebook]({% link notes/recursion.md %}) includes the different implementations of "count number of n-nucleotide sequences". It also contains a function that constructs a [binary tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree). This may be useful to refer to as you develop `build_random_function`.
