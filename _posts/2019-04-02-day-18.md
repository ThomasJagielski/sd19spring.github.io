## For next time

* Final project proposal due tomorrow morning (one submission per team)
* Friday, April 5 is an Olin Monday (no class)
* Reading Journal assigned for next class (Tuesday, April 9)


## MP4 show

Today we'll be showing off and celebrating your work from MP4! With your partner, set up a station with a laptop to demo your MP4 work in your MP4 studio. (If you place it near the boards you can write a title above.)

We'll divide the session in two - for the first half you should stay with the demo station and explain your project to visitors while your partner walks around the two studios visiting projects, then in the second half you will switch roles.


## Final project proposal

With your final project team, work on and submit your [project proposal](/assignments/final-project.html#project-proposal) to Canvas.
