## Schedule

Each team will have roughly 16 minutes to present (e.g., 10 minutes to present and 6 minutes for Q&A).  It's up to you exactly how you allocate the time between presentation and Q&A.  In addition to the verbal Q&A, each team will be collecting feedback via a Google form. Links to the feedback forms for each team will be posted on Canvas for convenience.

Please keep in mind the [guidelines for being a good presenter and a good audience member](/assignments/final-project/architectural-review#day-of-the-architectural-review)
