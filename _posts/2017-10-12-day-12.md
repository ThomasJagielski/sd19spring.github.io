* Concrete and abstract data types
    * tree (abstract) implemented as list + dict
    * GeneFinder: string (concrete) vs. DNA sequence (abstract)
        * `seq += 'X'` is legal in one and not the other.
        * An operation that is legal for the concrete type (“downstairs”) is one way to get a logic error instead of a runtime error.
        * A logic error produces a downstream runtime error (if you're lucky), or invalid output (if you're not)
    * Calculator: int and float (unit-less) are concrete. See [Mars climate rover](https://www.wired.com/2010/11/1110mars-climate-observer-report/).
    * CompArt. Concrete: string, list (of lists). These represent: function, expression (whose terms are expressions).
* Trade-offs: insertion versus query or retrieval.
* Functions are verbs; classes are nouns.
