## Set

A [**set**](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/stdtypes.html#set-types-set-frozenset) knows only whether it contains an element.

It's like a list that doesn't know many times or in what order its element occur. When you use a list just to test whether it contains an item, consider a set.

Or, it's a dictionary that stores only the keys, and doesn't care about the values.
A dict whose values are either absent or `True` (or absent or `1`), is a candidate for using a set instead.

## Études and Katas

Prrgramming **études** (using the music analogy from class), or **katas** (using a martial arts analogy), are exercises that prompt developing expertise at a particular level of construction.

Katas are a useful part of [deliberate practice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practice_(learning_method)#Deliberate_practice).
