## For Next Time

* Read Think Python Appendix A to prepare for Tuesday's conversation on debugging
* Add README to your project repository, update your architecture diagram, make sure your code is documented
* Submit [Code Review framing survey](https://goo.gl/forms/LQucKLrbyZOV3BEp2) today (instructions below)


## READMEs and Documentation

Every project should have a README file explaining what it does, how to run it, etc.
On GitHub in particular, this is your project's landing page and the first impression people will have of your work.
The final project [README rubric](/assignments/final-project/readme-rubric.html) includes guidelines for constructing a good README file, and we can discuss other considerations in class.

Even though you are not yet done with your project and thus may not be able to complete every section of the project README, we'd like you to post your first draft of the README today to help provide context for the code review exercise.

Preparing your repository for external readers and code review:
 - Post project README file.
 - Update and post system architecture diagram that you worked on day 17.
 - Solid documentation throughout, but especially the sections under review. 
   This means:
   - Docstring/header comment at the top of each file explaining what it does
   - Docstring for each class and (nontrivial) function
   - Comments for sections of code that are complex enough to need explanation


## Code Reviews


### How to link to a section of code in GitHub
 1. Go to your project repository on GitHub
 1. In the upper left, click on "[N] commits" to see your commit history.
  ![]({% link images/notes/day21/step1.png %})
 1. Find the commit for the point in time you'd like us to review (generally the most recent). Click the "<> - Browse the repository at this point in the history" button on the right.
  ![]({% link images/notes/day21/step2.png %})
 1. Navigate to the file you'd like us to review.
 1. Scroll down to the line number starting the section of code to review and click the line number. You should see the line highlighted in yellow.
  ![]({% link images/notes/day21/step3.png %})
 1. Copy the URL from your browser. It should end in an HTML anchor (e.g. ```#L45```) referring to the line number.
