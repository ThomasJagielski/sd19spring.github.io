* Technical debt
  * “Technical debt” is a standard term in industry.
   * The four quadrants can be a useful framework, but are not standard.
  * Many projects have a phase of building debt (especially as a demo deadline approaches), and paying down debt (immediately after a deadline)
  * “Debt” is sometimes called **entropy**. “Paying down technical debt” is **entropy reduction**.
* [Review] Catch a *specific* exception
  * Catching all exceptions masks errors.
  * Prevents code from being fragile.

* [Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com) starts December 1. This is an excellent source of programming practice puzzles.
* Peter Norvig's [2016 Advent of Code solutions](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/url/norvig.com/ipython/Advent%20of%20Code.ipynb) demonstrate programming techniques and Python style
