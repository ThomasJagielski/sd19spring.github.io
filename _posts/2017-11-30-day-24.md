## Technical debt

* “Technical debt” is a standard term in industry.
* The four quadrants can be a useful framework, but are not standard.
* Many projects have a phase of building debt (especially as a demo deadline approaches), and paying down debt (immediately after a deadline)
* “Debt” is sometimes called **entropy**. “Paying down technical debt” is **entropy reduction**.

## Exceptions Re-visited

* `catch SpecificException` good; `catch` bad.
* Catching all exceptions masks errors.
* Code can be *currently correct*, but still *fragile*.
* Perspectives: code base at a particular time; code as a snapshot in an evolving project

## Advent of Code

* [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) is a series of small self-contained programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels. [Advent of Code 2017](http://adventofcode.com/2017/) starts December 1.
* Peter Norvig's [2016 Advent of Code solutions](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/url/norvig.com/ipython/Advent%20of%20Code.ipynb) demonstrate programming techniques and Python style.
