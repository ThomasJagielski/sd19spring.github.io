## Diagrams

* static call graph
* dynamic call graph
* data flow

## Ways to be slow

* Process a large amount of input data (GeneFinder)
* Generate a large amount of output data (Computational Art)
* Use a slow resource, e.g. the web (Text Mining)

## Tuples

* Like lists
* Immutable
  * A tuple whose items are also immutable can key a dictionary
* Use `list` to turn a list into a tuple; `tuple` to turn a list into a tuple
* `(1,)` is a tuple with `len` = 1. It's the comma, not the parentheses, that make the tuple.
* Not covered in class:
  * `a, b = [1, 2]` and `a, b = (1, 2)` unpack a sequence
  * It's the comma that makes the tuple: `a, b = 1, 2` also works
  * An idiom: so does `a, b = b, a` to swap values
* Use a list when the *interpretation* of an item doesn't depend on its *position*.
  For example, a list of genes, or a list of classes.
* Use a tuple when different positions have different meanings. For example, (red, green, blue).

## Dicts

* A dict is like generalized lists (keys don't have to be integers)
* Keys don't need to be consecutive â€“ e.g. `{0: 'x', 1e6: 'y'}`
* Keys must be immutable

## Reasons to Cache

* Reproducible results
* Rapid results
* Avoid being mistook for an attacker

## Text Mining

* going out to the web
* caching
* exploratory

* due in three days
* less scaffolded
