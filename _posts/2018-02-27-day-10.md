## Reading Journal Debrief

### Bad Kangaroos

In this Reading Journal we looked at a very common error that can be very frustrating to debug:

```python
class Kangaroo:
    def __init__(self, name, contents=[]):	# Warning: mutable default argument bug!
        self.pouch_contents = contents
```

The core "[gotcha](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/writing/gotchas/#mutable-default-arguments)" here is that default argument values are evaluated *once* when the function is defined, not every time it is called.

In this case, it means that the new list is created one time, and each new `Kangaroo` instance (that did not provide contents to override the default) has a reference to the same list.

This would be true fof any mutable object as a default argument, not just `list` (e.g. `dict`, your custom classes). Here is another implementation, showing a Python idiom commonly used to avoid this bug:

```python
class Kangaroo:
    def __init__(self, name, contents=None):
        if contents == None:
            contents = []
        self.pouch_contents = contents
```

Here we've used `None` (immutable) as a stand-in for the case when no contents have been passed and we should create an empty list. The new list is created inside the body of the `__init__` method when it is called, so each `Kangaroo` instance gets its own empty list vs a shared reference.

General advice: avoid using mutable objects as default values of function arguments.

### Agenda: sorting objects

For this Reading Journal, you had to implement a `print_agenda` method that displays `Event` objects in chronological order.
The key challenge here was sorting the `Event`s: Python provides many 
[techniques for sorting](https://docs.python.org/3.6/howto/sorting.html),
but they don't know how to sensibly sort your custom objects without some help from you.

Let's imagine that you have a list of `Event`s. 
The first design choice to make is whether you should maintain the list in sorted order at all times, or sort it only when required (e.g. whenever `print_agenda` is called). There are pros and cons to each style, depending on application:

#### Always sorted

In this case the burden falls on your `add_event` method to ensure that you insert new `Event`s in chronological order (perhaps using your `is_after` method). It takes a little more time to add an `Event`, but you afterwards you can rely on the list being sorted at no extra cost.

#### Sort on demand

With this approach you have a simpler insertion process, but you must sort the list every time you need it to be in order. This may be more expensive depending on whether adding new `Event`s or printing the `Agenda` is more common.


Python knows how to sort built-in types (e.g. integers), but not your custom classes. Let's say you have a `Time` class:

```python
class Time:
    def __init__(self, hour=0, minute=0, second=0):
        self.hour = hour
        self.minute = minute
        self.second = second

    def to_int(self):
        return 60*(60*self.hour + self.minute) + self.second
```

#### Sorting key function
Python's `list.sort` method and `sorted` function both take an optional `key` parameter, which expects a function that takes the object to be sorted and returns a key used to sort it. We could write such a function for `Event`s:

```python
def event_start(event):
    """Given Event object containing a start Time, return time as sortable key"""
    return event.start.to_int()
```

and then use it to sort a list of Events: 

```python 
for event in sorted(some_events, key=event_start):
    ... do something
```

#### Anonymous lambda functions

If you just want to sort `Event`s, it can be a bit clunky to write the `event_start` function solely to pass as a `key` parameter.
You'll often see people use an anonymous `lambda` function (a function defined on the fly that is not bound to a name) for this purpose. Equivalently: 

```python
for event in sorted(some_events, key=lambda e: e.start.to_int())
    ... do something
```

#### Implement comparison operator(s)

If you implement the less-than [\_\_lt\_\_](https://docs.python.org/3.6/reference/datamodel.html#object.__lt__) method for your classes (so that `time1 < time2` works), then Python now knows how to sort your custom objects.

```python
# inside class Time:
    def __lt__(self, other):
        return self.to_int() < other.to_int()
```

### Agenda: \_\_str\_\_ vs \_\_repr\_\_

Several of you ran into interesting behavior when trying to print your custom classes using your `__str__` method:

```python
>>> times = [Time(6,20), Time(2,45), Time(4)]
>>> print(times[0])
06:20:00
>>> print(times)
[<__main__.Time object at 0x105b1d0b8>, <__main__.Time object at 0x105b1d0f0>, <__main__.Time object at 0x105b1d128>]
```

This arises because Python has two ways of converting an object into a string that are used differently. Read about each:
[\_\_str\_\_](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__str__)
and
[\_\_repr\_\_](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__repr__).


When printing collections like lists, the `__repr__` method is used for the contained objects. As an example of why, let's imagine our `TicTacToe` class has a pretty `__str__` method that gives:

```python
X| |O
-----
 |X|O
-----
O|X| 
```

If we used that for the `__repr__`, and printed a list of two `TicTacToe` objects, it would be a mess!:

```python
[X| |O
-----
 |X|O
-----
O|X| , X| |O
-----
 |X|O
-----
O|X| ]
```

vs

```python
[<__main__.TicTacToe object at 0x105b1d160>, <__main__.TicTacToe object at 0x105b1d168>]
```

When writing `__repr__` methods, a great goal is for the result to be a valid Python expression that could recreate the object (e.g. `Time(06,20,00)` not `06:20:00`).

If a class does not define a `__str__` method, the `__repr__` method is used instead (if it exists).

## Exercise: rewrite MP2 using classes

Now that we've learned about writing custom classes, let's circle back and revise your work from MP2 to use what you've learned.

TODO: Expand.


We're also available for conversation about issues that arose using classes in the last reading journals and `geometry.py`




### Diversion: git branch

TODO: Finish explanation

```
# Create a new branch to work on
$ git checkout -b ClassRewrite

# Do your work, make commits to the new branch without affecting master

# Optional: push your branch with work to GitHub
$ git push -u origin ClassRewrite

# Switch back to master branch
$ git checkout master

# You'll see your work disappear from the local directory but it's not gone! Just checkout ClassRewrite branch to see it again.
```

To see this visually, work through the first three levels of "[Learn Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/)"
