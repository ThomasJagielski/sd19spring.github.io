## Reading Journal Debrief

### Bad Kangaroos

In this Reading Journal we looked at a very common error that can be very frustrating to debug:

```python
class Kangaroo:
    def __init__(self, name, contents=[]):	# Warning: mutable default argument bug!
        self.pouch_contents = contents
```

The core "[gotcha](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/writing/gotchas/#mutable-default-arguments)" here is that default argument values are evaluated *once* when the function is defined, not every time it is called.

In this case, it means that the new list is created one time, and each new `Kangaroo` instance (that did not provide contents to override the default) has a reference to the same list.

This would be true fof any mutable object as a default argument, not just `list` (e.g. `dict`, your custom classes). Here is another implementation, showing a Python idiom commonly used to avoid this bug:

```python
class Kangaroo:
    def __init__(self, name, contents=None):
        if contents == None:
            contents = []
        self.pouch_contents = contents
```

Here we've used `None` (immutable) as a stand-in for the case when no contents have been passed and we should create an empty list. The new list is created inside the body of the `__init__` method when it is called, so each `Kangaroo` instance gets its own empty list vs a shared reference.

General advice: avoid using mutable objects as default values of function arguments.

## Agenda: sorting objects

For this Reading Journal, you had to implement a `print_agenda` method that prints `Events` in chronological order.
The key challenge here was sorting the `Event`s: Python provides many 
[techniques for sorting](https://docs.python.org/3.6/howto/sorting.html),
but they don't know how to sensibly sort your custom objects without some help from you.

Let's say that you have a lst of `Event`s. The first design choice to make is whether you should sort that list on demand (e.g. whenever `print_agenda` is called) or maintain the list in sorted order at all time.


```python
class Time:
    def __init__(self, hour=0, minute=0, second=0):
        self.hour = hour
        self.minute = minute
        self.second = second

    def to_int(self):
        return 60*(60*time.hour + time.minute) + time.second
```

Sort on demand or maintain sorted.


implement [\_\_lt\_\_](https://docs.python.org/3.6/reference/datamodel.html#object.__lt__) method for the class, so that `time1 < time2' works

### Agenda: str vs repr

Several of you ran into interesting behavior when trying to print your custom classes.

[\_\_repr\_\_](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__repr__)
[\_\_str\_\_](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__str__)

## Exercise: rewrite MP2 using classes

Now that we've learned about writing custom classes, let's circle back and revise your work from MP2 to use what you've learned.

TODO: Expand.


We're also available for conversation about issues that arose using classes in the last reading journals and `geometry.py`




### Diversion: git branch

TODO: Finish explanation

```
# Create a new branch to work on
$ git checkout -b ClassRewrite

# Do your work, make commits to the new branch without affecting master

# Optional: push your branch with work to GitHub
$ git push -u origin ClassRewrite

# Switch back to master branch
$ git checkout master

# You'll see your work disappear from the local directory but it's not gone! Just checkout ClassRewrite branch to see it again.
```

To see this visually, work through the first three levels of "[Learn Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/)"
