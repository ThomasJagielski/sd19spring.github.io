## Final Project Ideation

### Priming [10 minutes]
Today, you will do a few exercises today to help us get you onto teams, to start taking on the tasks outlined in the Final Project page. Like we did in Mini-Project 3, we have included more guidance for thinking about the ethical issues in your projects as you work and reflect.

Before we send you on a five week journey with two or three of your peers, we are going to have you examine your working preferences and dispositions, so that you can help the instructors assign teams that are well-suited for success - sometimes selecting close friends to work with is not the ideal SoftDes Final Project experience.


### Step 1 - complete your personal preferences survey honestly [15 minutes]
Please use this link to complete the preferences survey before we move on to the next phase of team formation today.

### Step 2 - Explore possibilities with peers [35 minutes]
The room is set up in a special configuration, where tables are numbered and have designated topics for exploration. Instructors will demonstrate how students will move through the room to brainstorm project possibilities within two different sets of domains with two different sets of classmates.

* Instructors model the brainstorming process [5 minutes]
  * we propose ideas within the domains we see on the table's printout.
	* we then enter several ideas from our table into a project possibilities google sheet. link.
* Students work with two to three students at their first assigned table [15 minutes]
* Students work with two to three students at their second assigned table [15 minutes]

### Step 3 - See what others have come up with [15 minutes]
You have time to look at project ideas from your peers in the project possibilities spreadsheet. You can also look back at the results from projects of past semesters.

### Step 4 - Free exploration [15 minutes]
Spend time near topics posted on the wall, talking with peers about opportunities that might challenge you and them.

### Step 5 - Fill out the final survey [10 minutes]
Please use this link to tell us your final thoughts about potential teammates and topics of interest to you.
