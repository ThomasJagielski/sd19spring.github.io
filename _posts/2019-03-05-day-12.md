## Ethics in text mining and analysis

Guest speaker [Dr. Erhardt Graeff](http://www.olin.edu/faculty/profile/erhardt-graeff)


## Alignment and bias

MP3 concrete example


## Starting from a blank repository
   - GitHub dealing with empty repo
   - README
   - gitignore and what _doesn't_ go in a repo (big stuff, stuff you don't own, secrets)
   - Starting a project (e.g. start from comments)

## Filesystem

 - Absolute vs relative
 - Using library to handle OS differences

## Text caching class example
