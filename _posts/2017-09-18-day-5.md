## GeneFinder review

    - complement; both strands; coding → AA

## GeneFinder part 2

    - how longest_ORF_noncoding works
    - analogy w/ Python?
    - going beyond

{% endcomment %}

## An analogy

* The cellular machinery transcribes/translates DNA to RNA to nucelotides to proteins, which comprise the cellular machinery.
* [PyPy](https://pypy.org) (Python in Python) parses/translates/interprets Python source code

    - this is a flow diagram

## Graph

    - a graph shows objects and relations

## Graphs and Call Graph

    - a call graph represents calling relations between subroutines (functions)
    - a control flow graph
    - modularity: thinking, testing, documenting
    - match description of problem
    - code comprehension – theme: views of your program. call hierarchy
    - this is part of general class

## Python and PyPi Ouroboros

## Modularity

## Introduce Computer Graphics

    - two kinds of graphics: vector and raster; GPS and dead reckoning
    - computing is a flashlight you can shine at: math, text, biology, geometry, graphics, vision
