## Mirroring the World

* Sometimes you can guess the structure of a program from its behavior.
  * Is it modular (suggesting functions)
  * Is something repeated (suggesting iteration)
  * Is it repeated with changes (suggesting parameters)
  * This is a form of **reverse engineering**.
* The behavior of a graphical program is its appearance.
    * This can make the behavior of a graphical program easier to understand.
    * "Visualizing" a program – drawing non-makes it easier to understand.
* Pretend something that wasn't generated by a program, was – what would the program look like?
    * This lets you write a program that simulates or reproduces reality.
    * It can also realize an artistic conception on computer, for richer modeling or interaction.
    * Many real-world artifacts are generated by computational processes.
