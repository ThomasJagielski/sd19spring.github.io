## For Next Time
* [By midnight tonight, submit a link to your website MVP](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeTdifO9C3ZsP_ctgXnkWoMVmUEaz_RG7gKet6156NgFjDjHg/viewform)

## Creating your Website MVP

Today, we're going to go through a set of activities to help you create your website MVP.  Before starting, refresh your memory on the main purpose of the [final project website](/assignments/final-project).

While you may not yet have all of the content to populate this page (e.g., you may not have content for your *results* section), you should be able to map out the main structure of your website, fill out some of the content, and include placeholders for content that you still need to generate.

Beyond helping you plan your website, doing this activity might also help focus your work on the project by reminding you of what is most important about what your team is doing.

### Make an outline

The guidelines in the final project assignment provide a great starting point for the content of your site.  They do not, however, mandate the exact structure and content of your site.  Using the ideas on the assignment page as a jumping off point, make an outline of the content you'd like on your site.  You should interpet the word *content* broadly (e.g., to include images, videos, sounds, etc.).  Additionally, if you plan on using multiple pages, make an outline of each page.

At a whiteboard or chalkboard, create an outline for your team's website.  Make sure to document this (e.g., by taking a picture) as it will likely come in handy later.

### Design your media

Likely some of what you wrote in your outline involves some sort of media (either video, audio, or images).  Choose a 1 or 2 key media and quickly sketch out their basic elements (e.g., using a rough sketch or a storyboard).

### Put together a skeleton

Now that you have some idea of your content, you should put an alpha version of your site up on the web.  To do this, you'll have to choose a website development / hosting platform.  The final project page has some guidance on this, however, you are welcome to utilize other platforms as well.

*For the purposes of the website MVP, you should choose something that allows you to get something up quickly.  There will be time for refining your layout later.*

If you are unsure about which platform to use, you might consider checking out [a very simple sample website](http://occamlab.github.io/tango_ros_bridge/) that we put together. This website is far from perfect, but hopefully it gives you a reasonable starting point. In order to put together a simple page like this, you should follow the [Github tutorial on Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) (note: that for this site we chose the option to host our site in the `/docs` directory of the master branch).  Please note that while our sample website only utilizes a single page, you can [add multiple pages to a Github Pages site](https://blog.github.com/2016-12-05-relative-links-for-github-pages/).

Here are some guidelines to consider when creating your MVP.
* If your website will utilize multiple pages, create (at least) a skeleton version of each page
* If there is content that you have created (e.g., your architectural diagram), consider adding it to your website MVP.
* For content that hasn't been generated yet, put a placeholder (either an image or text) that describes the content that will be there eventually.
* For longer sections of text that are either too time-consuming to generate now or whose details are to-be-determined, include the content in outline format.

### Turning in your work

[By midnight tonight, submit a link to your website MVP](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeTdifO9C3ZsP_ctgXnkWoMVmUEaz_RG7gKet6156NgFjDjHg/viewform). Along with a place to put your link, the form asks you if you have any specific areas you'd like feedback on. You can also submit links to additional materials (e.g., an picture of something you sketched on a whiteboard) that you'd like us to take a look at.
