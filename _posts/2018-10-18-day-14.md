## Today

* MP4 midpoint check-ins
* Repository polishing


## Midpoint check-ins

You should have already submitted your MP4 proposal to Canvas and received feedback on it from course staff.

You should also have posted a text status update with links to specific work in your repo, to help frame MP4's midpoint check-in.

Today in class, meet with course staff to discuss your progress, get suggestions for where to go next, and seek help on areas where you're stuck.


## READMEs and good project names

While you're not meeting with course staff, work with your team on [Assignment 14](/assignments/assignment-14) for next time.

The rest of class time is devoted to making forward progress with your team on MP4.

You can also go back to [previous days' pages](/notes), work through exercises you didn't finish, and get some more practice with areas of Python where you're a bit shaky.
