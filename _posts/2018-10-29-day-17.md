## For next time
* Reading Journal on analysis of algorithmic complexity


## MP4 demo session

With your partner, set up (at least one) laptop running your interactive program from MP4.
We'll have one partner stay with the laptop to explain your program and answer questions while the other roams around to try other projects, and we'll switch roles halfway through.

## Proposal reviews

Please bring a printed copy of your proposal and materials to take notes. Course staff will review your proposal with you and make suggestions.

While you're not reviewing your proposal, you can be moving forward with the research and implementation of your project. Your next major milestone is an Architectural Review on November 5.
