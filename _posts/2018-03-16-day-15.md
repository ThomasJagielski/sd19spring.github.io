## Today

* Resolving Git merge conflicts
* Final project Ideation

## Priming [10 minutes]
Individually, engage with the following prompts that will help you identify some important factors when designing your final project experience.

### Project Hopes
My ideal final project would...
* achieve impact beyond this class.
* connect to things I've already done.
* stretch me in my skills.
* be personally meaningful to me (for whatever reason: personal history, personal goals).
* be consistent with my ethical/political priorities.

For each of these, ask yourself why you care (or don’t) about each of these.

### Learning Goals
Identify the learning goals that are most important for you to achieve during the final project.  These could be software engineering skills, ways to apply computational principles, teaming strategies, communication skills, etc.  If you wind up with a high number of these (> 5), try to either eliminate less important goals or condense similar goals into a single goal.

## Individual Project Topic Ideation [7 minutes]
On post-its, jot down ideas for final projects.  Once you've transferred your ideas to post-its, categorize your ideas based on whether or not they are well-aligned with your project hopes and goals (perhaps group them into low, medium, and high coherence with these).

## Share with your neighbors [15 minutes]
*As sharer:* Share your hopes and goals.  Share two ideas that you came up with that you think are well aligned with your hopes and goals and two ideas that you are either unsure of the alignment or that you think have low / moderate alignment.  As you get feedback from the folks you are sharing with, you may consider jotting down new topics or modifying existing ones.

*As listener:* especially for projects that the sharer doesn't think are particularly well aligned with their hopes and goals, offer suggestions about how these two things could be brought into better alignment.  Alternatively, if you think there is a real tension that prevents a project topic from being compatible with someone’s hopes and goals, you can offer that opinion as well.

## Do Some Targeted Ideation (Round 1) [20 minutes]
We have set up stations for more targeted ideation.  We realize that there will be project ideas that don’t neatly fit into the stations that we have selected, but if you go to the station that seems most similar to a topic you are excited about, you are likely to find other folks who may be interested.

Round 1 Station List:
* Art
* Computational biology / bioinformatics
* Computer vision
* Educational tools
* Games (note: this is in both sessions)
* Pitch your random idea!

Once you arrive at the station, take turns pitching your favorite projects.  If you hear an idea that is particularly exciting, ask some clarifying questions or offer some suggestions.  Todo: not sure if this structure makes sense.

## Do Some Targeted Ideation (Round 2) [20 minutes]
Repeat round 1 for a new topic area.

Round 2 Station List:
* AI / machine learning
* Collaborative / social applications
* Data visualization
* Games (note: this is in both sessions)
* Music
* Productivity tools
