* Exceptions
  * Handles exceptional cases
  * *Raising an exception* is an alternative to *returning a value*
  * Use exceptions when there's no value it makes sense to return
  * Unlike a returned value, an exception can be handled by the caller, the caller's caller, etc.
  * Catch a specific exception. Catching all exceptions masks errors.
